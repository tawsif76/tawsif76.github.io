This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

Hello, This is Tawsif, 
======
I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. My passion lies in the intersection of computer networking and security, with a specific focus on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Currently, my research revolves around detecting attacks in Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN) systems. I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve intrusion detection in IoT-based systems, especially those using Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of safer and more reliable communication in vehicular networks, ensuring that they can handle the challenges of an increasingly connected world.
