Hello, This is Tawsif,
======
I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. I’m really passionate about computer networking and security, particularly in the context of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Right now, I’m focused on researching 
various kinds of attacks detection in Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN). My goal is to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance intrusion detection in IoT-based systems that use Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. I’m excited about the potential impact of my research in improving the security and efficiency of communication in connected vehicles.
