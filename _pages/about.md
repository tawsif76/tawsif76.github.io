Hello, This is Tawsif,
======
I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. My passion lies in the intersection of computer networking and security, with a specific focus on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Currently, my research revolves around detecting attacks in Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN) systems. I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve intrusion detection in IoT-based systems, especially those using Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of safer and more reliable communication in vehicular networks, ensuring that they can handle the challenges of an increasingly connected world.
